The beginning of modern engineering education in Egypt dates back to 1816 when the famous Wali; Mohammed Ali Pasha established “Madrasat El-Mohandeskhana” (which means in Turkish Language the School of Engineering). The school was headed by Hassan Afendy known as “El-Darwish El-Mousely” and located in El-Kalaa (the Citadel) district. It remained there until 1834 when it was moved to Bulaq, a district of Cairo.

In September 1854, the school was closed; but four years later in December 1858, a school for irrigation works at the Barrage and a school for building in the Citadel (Cairo) were established. The two schools were , however, closed in 1861. In 1866, a school of Irrigation and Architecture was re-established by the Khedive Ismail (son of Mohammed Ali Pasha), temporarily in Zaffran Palace, Abbassia (Cairo) and then in the Palace of Moustafa Fadel Pasha located at Darb El-Gamamiz (Cairo) in 1867.

Emerging Specializations
In 1866, two separate departments for Irrigation and Architecture were established. The study was extended to five years with the first as a preparatory year, and specialization took place in the final two years of study. In 1896, the two Departments of Irrigation and Architecture were grouped again in one single department.

The Royal School of Engineering
In October 1902, the school was moved to a temporary location in the premises of the School of Agriculture at Giza. By 1905, the new buildings of the “Royal School of Engineering” bordering Giza Zoo and facing Orman Park, were completed. The school was then moved to this location and remained there ever sense. In October 1908, study was once more divided into two departments for Irrigation and Architecture with specialization in the final two years. But in 1916, the school started to offer specialized studies in the final two years in five departments: Irrigation, Architecture, Municipal, Mechanical and Electrical Engineering.
